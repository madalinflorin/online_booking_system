    "firstP": "Located in Cluj-Napoca – the heart of Transylvania, BarberSHOP brings together top barbering services and a vibrant atmosphere where men can come get a modern haircut or a clean shave and share a few laughs at the bar. We are bringing back the times when barbershops were a social place, where men could discuss contemporary issues or about deeper things while having a cup of barista-quality coffee or a glass of Irish Whiskey while waiting to get a service.",
    "secondH2": "Why choose us ?",
    "secondP": "As you probably know from books or movies, in the old days, hairdressers were the real news centers of the time, and hairdressers were best friends. They played in society the role of psychologists, clergymen, confidants, comedians, everything the client demanded. Customer waiting long in line. And choosing a barber or a barber was a real art.",
    "secondP1": "We took the concept of hairdressing to another level. BarberSHOP comes with an urban theme, for the real man with a certain status; the real gentleman.",
    "secondP2": "The beard remains a symbol of masculinity, strength, maturity and wisdom. The communists banned it because they associated it with the image of the bourgeois. After the Revolution, the lords began to take more care of them. A big, thick beard is also a sign of health.",
    "secondP3": "In ancient times, in mysterious Egypt, a well-groomed, clean and shaven face was synonymous with elegance. The Egyptians were among the first to shave their facial hair using pieces of polished copper or bronze.",
    "secondP4": "The Greeks saw a sign of masculinity in their beards, and those who did not wear it were perceived as dishonorable.",
    "secondP5": "We at The BarberSHOP do not put labels and do not judge by the length of the beard or the style of the haircut. We are always available to customers. Our program is designed to meet the urban man of the 21st century. Our specialists are truly professionals and will try to be both a pleasant company for the chair and operative enough not to confuse the busy schedule of the real man of the 21st century.",
    "secondP6": "The BarberSHOP is a facelift. It combines traditional, masculine hairdressing with the current needs of hygiene, distance and last but not least availability.",

    "firstP1": "We use premium products, hand tools and warm towels. The services they offer range from a full shaved beard, to a contemporary hairstyle to an “Army Style”.",
